## Who I am  
My name is Jay Adamo, just another human trying navigate this crazy thing called life.  I like to share personal stories, interesting facts, jokes, and great advice ( that I am learning to listen to), as well as ways to make life more simple. I hold an Associates Degree in Humanities, a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies with a Minor in Wildlife Biology, in addition to Masters in Education credits and a former Data Science student. More importantly I am always observing, reading, researching, exploring spirutality and finding purpose.   

I would like to think of myself as a compassionate, problem-solver who wants to have a positive impact on this world. My passions are the great outdoors, personal growth, mental health, learning and teaching. I get a real thrill from exploring and finding beautiful natural wonders.  

I suffer from anxiety and depression, have overcome alcohol dependence, and recently learned I am introverted (sobriety does that). I have had many experiences both good and bad living in 5 different states chasing happiness. I have been married and divorced. I have had many jobs, friends, intimate relationships, 

As a former educator I am a terrific public speaker and generally know my audience. I also have worked in the human services field whwwhere I learned a lot about people. I really enjoy writing but I have to be passionate about the topics and have something positive, helpful, or funny to share.
